## AWS Public IP Management & Connectivity

### Dynamic Public IP Behavior (Important AWS Concept)

**AWS Public IP Assignment Rules:**
```
EC2 Instance Actions:
├── Stop → Start:  NEW public IP assigned (private IP unchanged)
├── Reboot:        SAME public IP retained (no change)
└── Terminate:     Public IP returned to AWS pool (lost forever)

Example for VM-4:
Private IP: 10.0.15.111 (permanent, never changes)
Public IP:  [Dynamic]    (changes daily if instance stopped/started)
```

**Daily Connection Procedure:**
1. **Check current public IP**: AWS Console → EC2 → Instances → VM-4 → Public IPv4 address
2. **Update PuTTY session**: Load saved session → Update "Host Name" → Save
3. **Connect as usual**: Use updated public IP, same SSH key, same username (ubuntu)

**Professional Solution - Elastic IP (Recommended for Production):**
```
AWS Console → VPC → Elastic IPs
1. Allocate Elastic IP address
2. Associate with VM-4 instance  
3. Update PuTTY with permanent Elastic IP
4. Cost: Free while attached to running instance
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Educational**: Understanding AWS networking fundamentals
- ✅ **Real-world**: Production systems always use Elastic IPs for public services
- ✅ **CA1 Prep**: Terraform will manage Elastic IP allocation automatically
- ✅ **Cost Awareness**: Free tier vs. production cost considerations

### Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
**Region**: us-east-2 (Ohio)

### VPC Configuration
```
VPC Name: plant-monitoring-vpc
VPC ID: vpc-0194f8de65ca597cc
CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
DNS Hostnames: Enabled
DNS Resolution: Enabled

Subnets:
├── Public Subnet: 10.0.0.0/20 (us-east-2a) - ACTUAL CONFIGURATION
│   └── Internet Gateway attached
│   └── VM-4 gets IP: 10.0.15.111 (within 10.0.0.0/20 range)
└── Private Subnet: 10.0.128.0/20 (us-east-2a) - ACTUAL CONFIGURATION
    └── Subnet ID: subnet-05412ac9583ba88e1
    └── NAT Gateway: plant-monitoring-nat-gateway (for internet access)
    └── VM-1 gets IP: 10.0.143.200 (within 10.0.128.0/20 range)

Network Components:
├── Internet Gateway: Provides internet access to public subnet
├── NAT Gateway: Provides outbound internet access for private subnet
│   └── Located in public subnet with Elastic IP
│   └── Cost: ~$0.045/hour + data transfer
└── Route Tables:
    ├── Public Route Table: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
    └── Private Route Table: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
```

**Network Architecture Analysis**: Your actual AWS setup uses different CIDR blocks than initially planned:

**Public Subnet: 10.0.0.0/20**
- **IP Range**: 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.15.254 (4,094 usable IPs)
- **AWS Reserved IPs**: 
  - 10.0.0.1 (VPC router/gateway)
  - 10.0.0.2 (AWS DNS server)
  - 10.0.0.3 (AWS reserved for future use)
  - 10.0.15.255 (Network broadcast address)
- **VM-4 Assignment**: 10.0.15.111
- **Why this IP**: AWS assigns IPs sequentially from available pool, likely other resources used earlier IPs

**Private Subnet: 10.0.128.0/20**
- **IP Range**: 10.0.128.1 to 10.0.143.254 (4,094 usable IPs)
- **AWS Reserved IPs**:
  - 10.0.128.1 (VPC router/gateway)
  - 10.0.128.2 (AWS DNS server)
  - 10.0.128.3 (AWS reserved for future use)
  - 10.0.143.255 (Network broadcast address)
- **VM-1 Assignment**: 10.0.143.200
- **Why this IP**: Sequential assignment from available pool within subnet range

### Why AWS Used /20 Subnets Instead of /24

**AWS VPC Design Decisions:**

1. **Default VPC Wizard Behavior**: When creating a VPC through the AWS Console wizard, it often suggests `/20` subnets to provide more IP addresses per subnet
2. **Availability Zone Planning**: AWS assumes you might want to create multiple subnets per AZ for different tiers (public, private, database)
3. **Future Growth**: `/20` provides 4,094 usable IPs vs `/24` which only provides 254 usable IPs
4. **AWS Best Practices**: Larger subnets reduce the need for additional subnets as infrastructure grows

**CIDR Block Comparison:**
```
/16 VPC (10.0.0.0/16):     65,536 total IPs
├── /20 Subnet:             4,096 IPs per subnet (16 possible subnets)
└── /24 Subnet:               256 IPs per subnet (256 possible subnets)
```

**Your Actual Subnet Layout:**
```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)
├── Public:  10.0.0.0/20   (10.0.0.1    → 10.0.15.254)  [4,094 usable]
├── Private: 10.0.128.0/20 (10.0.128.1  → 10.0.143.254) [4,094 usable]
├── Available: 10.0.16.0/20 to 10.0.127.255/20 (7 more /20 blocks)
└── Available: 10.0.144.0/20 to 10.0.255.255/20 (7 more /20 blocks)
```

### VM Specifications - ACTUAL CONFIGURATION

| VM Name | Instance Type | vCPUs | RAM | Storage | Subnet | Private IP | Public IP | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------|-----|---------|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| VM-1-Kafka | t2.micro | 1 | 1GB | 8GB EBS | Private | **10.0.143.200** ✅ | None | Running |
| VM-2-MongoDB | t2.micro | 1 | 1GB | 8GB EBS | Private | **10.0.135.192** ✅ | None | Running |
| VM-3-Plant-Processor | t2.micro | 1 | 1GB | 8GB EBS | Private | **10.0.130.79** ✅ | None | Running |
| VM-4-Home-Assistant | t2.micro | 1 | 1GB | 8GB EBS | Public | **10.0.15.111** ✅ | [Elastic IP] | Running |

**Operating System**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (all VMs)  
**Key Pair**: plant-monitoring-key.pem

**IP Address Pattern Analysis**:
- ✅ **VM-1**: 10.0.143.200 (high end of 10.0.128.0/20 range - normal AWS behavior)
- ✅ **VM-4**: 10.0.15.111 (high end of 10.0.0.0/20 range - normal AWS behavior)
- ✅ **VM-2**: 10.0.135.192 (mid-range of 10.0.128.0/20 - shows distributed allocation)
- ✅ **VM-3**: 10.0.130.79 (lower range of 10.0.128.0/20 - confirms distributed allocation)

**AWS IP Assignment Logic**: 
- AWS assigns IPs from available pool within subnet range
- Your VMs show distributed allocation across the entire 10.0.128.0/20 private subnet
- Non-sequential assignment indicates other AWS resources or different creation times

## AWS IP Discovery & Documentation Update Process

### How to Get Actual VM IP Addresses

**Method 1: AWS Console (Easiest)**
```
1. AWS Console → EC2 → Instances
2. Select each VM instance
3. In the "Details" tab, look for:
   - Private IPv4 address
   - Public IPv4 address (for VM-4 only)
4. Note the subnet ID to confirm placement
```

**Method 2: AWS CLI**
```powershell
# Get all instances in your VPC with their IPs
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-0194f8de65ca597cc" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key=='Name'].Value|[0],PrivateIpAddress,PublicIpAddress,SubnetId,State.Name]" --output table

# Get specific instance details by name tag
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=VM-2-MongoDB" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,PrivateIpAddress,SubnetId]" --output table
```

**Method 3: From Within Each VM (SSH Required)**
```bash
# Check private IP from inside the VM
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4

# Check public IP (VM-4 only)
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

## ✅ FINAL IP CONFIGURATION SUMMARY - COMPLETED

**All VM IP addresses have been discovered and updated throughout the documentation:**

| VM | Service | Private IP | Subnet | Status |
|----|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| VM-1 | Kafka (KRaft) | **10.0.143.200** | Private (10.0.128.0/20) | ✅ Updated |
| VM-2 | MongoDB | **10.0.135.192** | Private (10.0.128.0/20) | ✅ Updated |
| VM-3 | Plant Processor | **10.0.130.79** | Private (10.0.128.0/20) | ✅ Updated |
| VM-4 | Home Assistant + Sensors | **10.0.15.111** | Public (10.0.0.0/20) | ✅ Updated |

**Key Configuration Updates Completed:**

ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.143.200  # VM-1 Kafka
ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.135.192  # VM-2 MongoDB  
ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.130.79   # VM-3 Processor

# Test service connectivity:
ping 10.0.143.200    # Should reach Kafka
ping 10.0.135.192    # Should reach MongoDB
ping 10.0.130.79     # Should reach Processor
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Test all SSH connections using the updated IPs
2. Deploy and test the complete IoT pipeline
3. Verify end-to-end data flow from sensors to dashboard
4. Document any remaining connectivity or configuration issues

---

**Why VM-1 got 10.0.143.200:**
1. **High-end Assignment**: AWS often assigns IPs from the higher end of the range when there are many available
2. **DHCP Pool Logic**: AWS DHCP service manages IP allocation across the entire `/20` range
3. **No Fragmentation**: Since this is a new subnet, AWS can assign efficiently without gaps

**Prediction for VM-2 and VM-3:**
- If created soon after VM-1: **10.0.143.201, 10.0.143.202**
- If created later with other AWS activities: **Could be anywhere in 10.0.128.0/20 range**
- Most likely: **Sequential IPs near 10.0.143.200**

### Expected IP Patterns Based on AWS Behavior

**Most Likely Scenario** (based on VM-1 being 10.0.143.200):
```
VM-1: 10.0.143.200 ✅ (confirmed)
VM-2: 10.0.143.201 or 10.0.143.xxx (sequential assignment)
VM-3: 10.0.143.202 or 10.0.143.xxx (sequential assignment)
VM-4: 10.0.15.111 ✅ (confirmed)
```

**Alternative Scenario** (if VMs created at different times):
```
VM-1: 10.0.143.200 ✅ (confirmed)
VM-2: 10.0.128.xxx to 10.0.143.xxx (anywhere in private subnet)
VM-3: 10.0.128.xxx to 10.0.143.xxx (anywhere in private subnet)  
VM-4: 10.0.15.111 ✅ (confirmed)
```

## Complete AWS IP Assignment Analysis

### What Actually Happened vs. Original Plan

**Original Documentation Plan:**
```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
├── Public Subnet:  10.0.0.0/24  → VM-4: 10.0.0.10
└── Private Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24  → VM-1: 10.0.1.10, VM-2: 10.0.1.20, VM-3: 10.0.1.30
```

**AWS Reality (What You Actually Got):**
```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16  ✅ Same
├── Public Subnet:  10.0.0.0/20   → VM-4: 10.0.15.111    (4,094 available IPs)
└── Private Subnet: 10.0.128.0/20 → VM-1: 10.0.143.200   (4,094 available IPs)
                                   → VM-2: 10.0.135.192   (distributed allocation)
                                   → VM-3: 10.0.130.79    (distributed allocation)
```

### Why AWS Made These Choices

1. **Subnet Size (`/20` instead of `/24`)**:
   - **AWS Default**: VPC Wizard defaults to `/20` for better scalability
   - **Your Choice**: You likely accepted AWS suggestions during subnet creation
   - **Impact**: 16x more IP addresses per subnet (4,094 vs 254)

2. **Subnet Starting Points (`10.0.0.0/20` and `10.0.128.0/20`)**:
   - **AWS Logic**: Non-overlapping `/20` blocks within your `/16` VPC
   - **Pattern**: AWS often uses binary boundaries (128 = 10000000 in binary)
   - **Efficiency**: Maximizes available IP space for future subnets

3. **Specific IP Assignments**:
   - **VM-4: 10.0.15.111**: High end of public subnet range
   - **VM-1: 10.0.143.200**: High end of private subnet range  
   - **VM-2: 10.0.135.192**: Mid-range of private subnet - shows distributed allocation
   - **VM-3: 10.0.130.79**: Lower range of private subnet - confirms non-sequential assignment
   - **Pattern**: AWS DHCP assigns from available pool, not necessarily sequential

### Educational Value

**This scenario perfectly demonstrates:**
✅ **Real AWS Behavior**: Documentation vs reality gap is common
✅ **Network Planning**: Importance of verifying actual vs planned architecture  
✅ **CIDR Understanding**: How `/20` vs `/24` affects available IP ranges
✅ **Infrastructure as Code**: Why CA1 (Terraform) prevents these surprises
✅ **Troubleshooting Skills**: Network connectivity diagnosis in cloud environments

**For CA1 Assignment**: You'll use Terraform to explicitly define subnet CIDRs, eliminating these surprises:
```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/24"  # Exactly what you want
}
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"  # Exactly what you want  
}
```

# Exit and re-login for group membership to take effect
```

**Kafka Configuration**:

> **Note**: After multiple deployment attempts with ZooKeeper-based and persistent volume configurations that failed due to Docker volume permission issues on EC2, the final working solution uses KRaft mode (ZooKeeper-free) without persistent volumes.

**Deployment Files**: See `vm-configurations/vm-1-kafka/` folder in this repository for:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete Kafka KRaft configuration
- `README.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions

**Key Configuration Features**:
- **KRaft Mode**: No ZooKeeper dependency
- **Memory Optimized**: 400MB heap size for t2.micro
- **Auto-restart**: Service restarts on failure  
- **Health Checks**: Automatic service monitoring
- **Network**: Accessible at 10.0.143.200:9092

**Quick Deployment**:
```bash
# Copy repository files to VM-1
scp -r vm-configurations/vm-1-kafka/* ubuntu@VM-1-IP:/opt/kafka/
cd /opt/kafka
sudo docker compose up -d
```

**Verify Deployment**:
```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# View startup logs
docker compose logs -f kafka

# Should see "Kafka Server started" at the end
```

**Create Topics**:
```bash
# Now that Kafka is successfully running, create the topics:
cd /opt/kafka

# Using the new docker compose command structure (container name: kafka-kafka-1)
docker compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh --create --topic plant-sensors --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
docker compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh --create --topic plant-alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1  
docker compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh --create --topic plant-actions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

# Verify topics were created
docker compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Alternative using full container name if docker compose exec doesn't work:
# sudo docker exec kafka-kafka-1 kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

**Test Kafka Installation**:

#### Kafka Deployment Troubleshooting

**Issues Encountered and Solutions:**

1. **Container Restart Loops with Volume Permission Errors**
   - **Problem**: Docker containers repeatedly restarting with errors like:
     ```
     Command [/usr/local/bin/dub path /var/lib/kafka/data writable] FAILED
     ```
   - **Root Cause**: Docker volume permissions conflicts on EC2 Ubuntu instances
   - **Solution**: Removed persistent volumes and used `/tmp/kafka-logs` for storage
   - **Trade-off**: Data is not persistent across container restarts, but suitable for development/testing

2. **ZooKeeper Dependency Complexity**
   - **Problem**: Managing ZooKeeper + Kafka created additional points of failure
   - **Solution**: Switched to KRaft mode (Kafka Raft) which eliminates ZooKeeper dependency
   - **Benefits**: Simplified architecture, reduced memory footprint, fewer moving parts

3. **Memory Constraints on t2.micro**
   - **Problem**: Default Kafka memory settings too high for t2.micro (1GB RAM)
   - **Solution**: Optimized heap settings: `-Xmx256m -Xms128m`
   - **Result**: Stable operation within t2.micro constraints

4. **Docker Compose Command Evolution**
   - **Note**: Used `docker compose` (new syntax) instead of `docker-compose` (legacy)
   - **Benefit**: Better integration with modern Docker installations

**Key Lessons Learned:**
- Persistent storage on cloud VMs requires careful permission management
- KRaft mode is more suitable for single-node Kafka deployments
- Memory optimization is critical for constrained environments
- Simplicity often trumps feature completeness in educational contexts

## Home Assistant MQTT Sensor Configuration

### Automatic MQTT Discovery

The Plant Processor automatically publishes MQTT discovery messages when it starts, eliminating the need for manual sensor configuration. Home Assistant will automatically detect and create all plant sensors.

**Automatic Sensor Discovery Process:**

1. **Plant Processor publishes discovery messages** on startup:
   ```
   Published discovery for Plant 001 Moisture
   Published discovery for Plant 001 Health
   Published discovery for Plant 001 Light
   Published discovery for Plant 001 Temperature
   Published discovery for Plant 001 Status
   Published discovery for Plant 002 Moisture
   Published discovery for Plant 002 Health
   Published discovery for Plant 002 Light
   Published discovery for Plant 002 Temperature
   Published discovery for Plant 002 Status
   ```

2. **Home Assistant automatically creates sensors** with proper:
   - Device classes (humidity, illuminance, temperature)
   - Units of measurement (%, lux, °C, pts)
   - Icons (water-percent, lightbulb, thermometer, leaf, sprout)
   - Unique IDs for persistent configuration

**Verify Automatic Discovery:**

```bash
# Check Home Assistant discovers sensors automatically
ssh -i plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.15.111
cd /opt/homeassistant

# Monitor discovery messages being sent
docker compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "homeassistant/sensor/+/config" -v

# Monitor sensor state updates
docker compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "homeassistant/sensor/+/state" -v
```

**Home Assistant Interface:**

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → MQTT**
   - All plant sensors appear automatically
   - Each sensor shows proper device class and unit

2. **Overview Dashboard**  
   - Sensors auto-appear with live data
   - No manual configuration required

**Expected Sensor Values:**
- **Moisture**: 20-65% (varies by plant type)
- **Light**: 200-1000 lux (realistic indoor levels)  
- **Temperature**: 18-30°C (room temperature range)
- **Health Score**: 70-100 points (based on plant analysis)
- **Status**: "healthy", "needs_attention", or "critical"

**Troubleshooting:**

If sensors don't appear automatically:
- Check Plant Processor logs: `docker compose logs plant-processor`
- Verify MQTT discovery is enabled in Home Assistant
- Restart Plant Processor: `docker compose restart plant-processor`
- Check MQTT broker logs: `docker compose logs mosquitto`

## Data Pipeline Wiring & Testing

### Pipeline Flow Verification

**1. Producer → Kafka Topic**
```bash
# Monitor plant-sensors topic (use actual container name)
sudo docker exec kafka-kafka-1 kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic plant-sensors --from-beginning

# Alternative using docker compose:
docker compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic plant-sensors --from-beginning
```

**2. Kafka → Processor → MongoDB**
```bash
# Verify MongoDB insertions
mongosh --host 10.0.135.192:27017 -u plantuser -p PlantUserPass123! --authenticationDatabase plant_monitoring
> use plant_monitoring
> db.sensor_readings.find().sort({_id:-1}).limit(5)
```

**3. Processor → Home Assistant (MQTT)**
```bash
# Monitor MQTT messages
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "homeassistant/sensor/+/state"
```

**4. End-to-End Test Results**

Sample sensor reading from Plant 001:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-02T00:31:15.951Z",
  "plantId": "plant-001",

## Security Implementation

### SSH Key Authentication
```bash
# Password authentication disabled in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
```

### Step 8: Test Connectivity & Configure PuTTY

**Windows PuTTY Configuration for SSH Key Authentication**

1. **Launch PuTTY Configuration**:
   - Open PuTTY from Start Menu or Desktop
   - In the "Session" category, you'll configure the connection

2. **Configure Session Settings**:
   ```
   Host Name (or IP address): [VM-4-PUBLIC-IP]
   Port: 22
   Connection type: SSH
   Saved Sessions: VM-4-Home-Assistant-Bastion
   ```

3. **Configure SSH Key Authentication**:
   - Navigate to: `Connection` → `SSH` → `Auth` → `Credentials`
   - In "Private key file for authentication" field:
   - Click "Browse..." button
   - Navigate to your `plant-monitoring-key.ppk` file
   - Select the `.ppk` file and click "Open"

4. **Configure Connection Settings** (Optional but recommended):
   - Navigate to: `Connection`
   - Set "Seconds between keepalives" to `60`
   - Check "Enable TCP keepalives"

5. **Save Session Configuration**:
   - Navigate back to "Session" category
   - Ensure "VM-4-Home-Assistant-Bastion" is in the "Saved Sessions" field
   - Click "Save" to store these settings

6. **Test Initial Connection to VM-4 (Bastion Host)**:
   ```
   Click "Open" to connect
   Login as: ubuntu
   ```
   
   **Expected Output**:
   ```
   Authenticating with public key "plant-monitoring-key"
   Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-1009-aws x86_64)
   
   Last login: [timestamp] from [your-ip]
   ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-10:~$
   ```

7. **Convert .ppk to .pem Format** (Required for VM-4 Jump Access):
   
   Since AWS only provides `.ppk` files through the console, you need to convert it to `.pem` format:
   
   **Using PuTTYgen to Convert .ppk to .pem**:
   ```
   1. Open PuTTYgen (Start Menu → PuTTY → PuTTYgen)
   2. Click "Load" button
   3. Navigate to your plant-monitoring-key.ppk file
   4. Select "All Files (*.*)" in file type dropdown if needed
   5. Select your .ppk file and click "Open"
   6. Click "Conversions" menu → "Export OpenSSH key"
   7. Save as: plant-monitoring-key.pem
   8. Keep this .pem file secure alongside your .ppk file
   ```

8. **Test SSH Jump to Private VMs from VM-4**:
   
   **Copy SSH Key to VM-4 for Jump Access**:
   ```bash
   # On VM-4, create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   
   # Copy the private key content to VM-4
   nano ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem
   # Paste the content from your converted .pem file here, then save (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
   
   # Set correct permissions
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem
   ```
   
   **Test Connections to Private VMs**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection to VM-1 (Kafka)
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.143.200
   # Should connect successfully, then exit with: exit
   
   # Test connection to VM-2 (MongoDB) - CONFIRMED IP
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.135.192
   # Should connect successfully, then exit with: exit
   
   # Test connection to VM-3 (Processor) - CONFIRMED IP
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/plant-monitoring-key.pem ubuntu@10.0.130.79
   # Should connect successfully, then exit with: exit
   ```

**Alternative: PuTTY Session Configuration for Direct Jump Connections**

For easier access to private VMs, configure additional PuTTY sessions:

1. **VM-1 through Bastion** (duplicate pattern for VM-2, VM-3 with their actual IPs):
   ```
   Session Configuration:
   - Host Name: 10.0.143.200  ✅ (VM-1 confirmed)
   - Host Name: 10.0.135.192  ✅ (VM-2 confirmed)  
   - Host Name: 10.0.130.79   ✅ (VM-3 confirmed)
   - Port: 22
   - Connection type: SSH
   - Saved Sessions: VM-1-Kafka-via-Bastion (or VM-2-MongoDB-via-Bastion, etc.)
   
   Connection → SSH → Auth → Credentials:
   - Private key file: plant-monitoring-key.ppk
   
   Connection → Proxy:
   - Proxy type: SSH
   - Proxy hostname: [VM-4-PUBLIC-IP]
   - Port: 22
   - Username: ubuntu
   - Private key file: plant-monitoring-key.ppk
   ```

**Connectivity Test Checklist**:
- ✅ PuTTY connects to VM-4 using `.ppk` key
- ✅ VM-4 can SSH to VM-1 (10.0.143.200) ✅ CONFIRMED IP
- ✅ VM-4 can SSH to VM-2 (10.0.135.192) ✅ CONFIRMED IP
- ✅ VM-4 can SSH to VM-3 (10.0.130.79) ✅ CONFIRMED IP
- ✅ No password prompts (key authentication working)
- ✅ All VMs respond with Ubuntu welcome message

**Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Issues**:

1. **"Destination Host Unreachable" from Wrong IP**:
   
   **Problem**: VM-4 cannot ping private VMs, traffic shows wrong source IP (e.g., 10.0.15.111 instead of 10.0.0.10)
   
   **Root Cause**: Subnet CIDR blocks don't match the documented architecture or route table misconfiguration
   
   **Solution Steps**:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Check current network configuration on VM-4
   ip addr show
   ip route show
   
   # Step 2: Verify AWS subnet configuration matches documentation
   # In AWS Console → VPC → Subnets, verify:
   # - Public Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24 (not 10.0.15.0/24)
   # - Private Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
   
   # Step 3: Check VM-4's actual private IP
   curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
   # Should return 10.0.0.10, not 10.0.15.x
   
   # Step 4: Check route tables in AWS Console
   # Public Subnet Route Table should have:
   # - 10.0.0.0/16 → local
   # - 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
   
   # Private Subnet Route Table should have:
   # - 10.0.0.0/16 → local
   # - 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway (if needed)
   ```
   
   **Quick Fix if Subnets are Wrong**:
   - **Option A**: Update documentation to match actual AWS configuration
   - **Option B**: Recreate subnets with correct CIDR blocks (recommended)

2. **Subnet CIDR Mismatch Resolution**:
   
   If your actual AWS setup uses different CIDR blocks, update the architecture:
   ```
   # If AWS shows you're actually using:
   # Public Subnet: 10.0.15.0/24
   # Private Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
   
   # Then update all IP references:
   # VM-4: 10.0.15.10 (instead of 10.0.0.10)
   # Security Groups: 10.0.0.0/16 → covers both subnets
   ```

3. **Security Group Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure VM-1's security group allows ICMP from VM-4's subnet
   # In AWS Console → EC2 → Security Groups → SG-Kafka
   # Add rule: All ICMP - IPv4 | Source: 10.0.0.0/16 (or 10.0.15.0/24)
   ```

4. **Network ACL Check**:
   ```bash
   # Verify Network ACLs allow traffic between subnets
   # AWS Console → VPC → Network ACLs
   # Should allow inbound/outbound for subnet-to-subnet communication
   ```

**Troubleshooting Common PuTTY Issues**:

1. **"Server refused our key" Error**:
   - Verify you're using the `.ppk` file (not `.pem`)
   - Ensure the key was generated for the correct EC2 instances
   - Check that the key file path is correct in PuTTY

2. **"Connection timed out" Error**:
   - Verify the public IP address is correct
   - Check that Security Group allows SSH (port 22) from your IP
   - Confirm EC2 instance is running and has passed status checks

3. **"Permission denied" Error**:
   - Ensure you're logging in as `ubuntu` user
   - Verify the private key matches the key pair used when launching instances
   - Check that the `.ppk` file was converted correctly from `.pem`

**Key File Security Best Practices**:
- Keep your `.ppk` and `.pem` files in a secure location
- Never share private keys via email or unencrypted storage
- Set appropriate file permissions on the key files
- Consider using different key pairs for different environments

### Container Security (Non-root users)
All containers run as non-root users:
- MongoDB: `user: mongodb`
- Home Assistant: `user: "1000:1000"`  
- Plant Sensors: `user: "1001:1001"`
- Mosquitto: `user: mosquitto`

### Firewall Configuration
Security groups restrict access to only required ports and sources as documented in the network architecture section.

### Secret Management
- Database passwords stored in environment variables (not in code)
- SSH keys properly secured with 400 permissions
- No hardcoded secrets in Docker images

## Troubleshooting & Known Issues

### Major Issues Resolved During Implementation

1. **✅ RESOLVED: AWS Dynamic Public IP Address Management**
   - **AWS Behavior**: Public IP addresses change every time EC2 instances are stopped/started
   - **Impact**: PuTTY sessions and saved connections become invalid after instance restarts
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - Connection timeout to previously working public IP
     - "Host unreachable" errors from saved PuTTY sessions
     - Need to look up new public IP address daily
   - **Root Cause**: AWS assigns public IPs from a dynamic pool unless Elastic IP is allocated
   - **Key Distinction**:
     ```
     Private IP (VM-4): 10.0.15.111 → NEVER changes
     Public IP (VM-4):  [Dynamic]   → Changes on stop/start (not reboot)
     ```
   - **Solutions**:
     - **Temporary**: Update PuTTY sessions with new public IP daily
     - **Permanent**: Allocate Elastic IP address to VM-4 for static public IP
   - **Production Practice**: Always use Elastic IPs for bastion hosts and public services
   - **Cost Impact**: Elastic IP is free when attached, ~$0.005/hour when unattached

2. **✅ RESOLVED: AWS Security Group Misconfiguration (Critical Learning)**
   - **Problem**: VM-4 could not connect to any other VMs via SSH or application protocols
   - **Root Cause**: Accidentally configured restrictive **outbound rules** on VM-4 instead of **inbound rules**
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - `telnet 10.0.143.200 22` - connection timeout
     - `ssh` - connection timeout  
     - `ping` - 100% packet loss to all private VMs
   - **Why This Broke Everything**: Outbound rules control what VM-4 can send OUT to other systems
     - Blocked SSH connections (port 22) to private VMs
     - Blocked Kafka data transmission (port 9092) to VM-1
     - Blocked internet access for package downloads (ports 80/443)
     - Blocked DNS resolution (port 53)
   - **Solution**: Corrected security group configuration:
     ```
     VM-4 Correct Configuration:
     Inbound Rules:  
     - SSH (22): [Your-IP-Address]/32 (admin access only)
     - Home Assistant (8123): 0.0.0.0/0 (public dashboard access)
     - MQTT (1883): 10.0.0.0/16 (internal IoT communication)
     
     Outbound Rules:
     - All Traffic (All protocols): 0.0.0.0/0 (allow all outbound - AWS default)
     ```
   - **Key Learning**: AWS Security Groups work differently than traditional firewalls
     - **Inbound rules**: Control what traffic can reach your VM
     - **Outbound rules**: Control what your VM can send out (usually left as "allow all")
     - **Default behavior**: Inbound = deny all, Outbound = allow all
   - **Prevention**: Always verify security group configurations immediately after VM creation
   - **Educational Value**: Perfect example of infrastructure configuration affecting application connectivity

2. **✅ RESOLVED: AWS Systems Manager Access**
   - **Problem**: "SSM Agent is not online" error when trying to use AWS Session Manager
   - **Root Cause**: EC2 instances need IAM role with Systems Manager permissions
   - **Solution**: Created and attached `EC2-SSM-Role` with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy
   - **Additional Setup**: For private subnet instances, either NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints required for SSM connectivity
   - **Status**: Successfully resolved, Session Manager now available as backup access method

3. **✅ RESOLVED: Network ACL ICMP Restriction (Educational)**
   - **Problem**: VM-1 ping fails but SSH works perfectly  
   - **Root Cause**: Network ACL blocks ICMP traffic while allowing TCP traffic
   - **Discovery**: SSH connection successful: `VM-1 SSH SUCCESS ip-10-0-143-200`
   - **Analysis**: 
     - ✅ TCP port 22 (SSH): Allowed by Network ACL
     - ❌ ICMP (ping): Blocked by Network ACL
     - ✅ Application services will work (TCP/UDP protocols)
   - **Impact**: No impact on IoT pipeline functionality - all services use TCP ports
   - **Solution**: Optional - Add ICMP allow rule to Network ACL if ping diagnostics needed
   - **Real-world Relevance**: Production environments often disable ICMP for security
   - **Status**: ✅ Proceeding with installation - SSH connectivity confirmed working

4. **✅ RESOLVED: Private Subnet Internet Access (NAT Gateway Required)**
   - **Problem**: `sudo apt update` fails on VM-1/VM-2/VM-3 with "Network is unreachable" errors
   - **Root Cause**: Private subnet VMs cannot reach internet for package downloads without NAT Gateway
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - Connection timeout to Ubuntu package repositories
     - Cannot reach security.ubuntu.com or us-east-2.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com
     - IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity failures to external services
   - **AWS Architecture Issue**: Private subnets require NAT Gateway for outbound internet access
   - **Solution Steps**:
     ```
     1. AWS Console → VPC → NAT gateways → Create NAT gateway
        Name: plant-monitoring-nat-gateway
        Subnet: [PUBLIC subnet where VM-4 is located]
        Connectivity type: Public
        Elastic IP: Allocate new Elastic IP
     
     2. AWS Console → VPC → Route tables
        Select private subnet route table (10.0.128.0/20)
        Routes tab → Edit routes → Add route:
        Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        Target: NAT Gateway (plant-monitoring-nat-gateway)
     
     3. Test connectivity from VM-1:
        ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
        sudo apt update (should now work)
     ```
   - **Cost Impact**: ~$0.045/hour + data transfer (~$2-3 for assignment duration)
   - **Production Relevance**: Standard requirement for private subnet workloads
   - **Status**: ✅ Internet connectivity confirmed, package installation ready

5. **✅ PLANNING COMPLETE: Network Architecture Documentation Gap**
   - **Discovery**: AWS VPC wizard created different CIDR blocks than initially documented
   - **Actual AWS Configuration**:
     ```
     VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
     ├── Public Subnet:  10.0.0.0/20   → VM-4: 10.0.15.111
     └── Private Subnet: 10.0.128.0/20 → VM-1: 10.0.143.200, VM-2: 10.0.135.192, VM-3: 10.0.130.79
     ```
   - **vs. Initial Plan**: `/24` subnets with sequential IP addressing
   - **Impact**: All documentation updated to reflect actual AWS configuration
   - **Learning**: Always verify actual vs. planned infrastructure before application deployment

### Common Issues Still to Watch For (During Software Installation)

4. **Kafka Connection Issues** (Expected Tomorrow)
   - **Potential Problem**: Containers couldn't reach Kafka from other VMs
   - **Prepared Solution**: Update `KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` to use private IP: `PLAINTEXT://10.0.143.200:9092`

5. **MongoDB Authentication** (Expected Tomorrow)
   - **Potential Problem**: Initial connection failures due to auth configuration
   - **Prepared Solution**: Add `--auth` flag and proper user creation
   - **Verification Command**: `mongosh --host 10.0.135.192:27017 -u plantuser -p`

6. **Container Memory Constraints** (Expected with t2.micro)
   - **Anticipated Issue**: Services may run out of memory on 1GB instances
   - **Prepared Solution**: All docker-compose files pre-configured with memory limits and reduced heap sizes
   - **Monitor**: Use `docker stats` to watch memory usage during deployment

7. **Container Auto-restart** (Setup Tomorrow)
   - **Required**: Services must restart after VM reboot (assignment requirement)
   - **Solution Ready**: Add `restart: unless-stopped` to all docker-compose services
   - **Additional**: Create systemd services for docker-compose stacks

### Performance Considerations
- **t2.micro limitations**: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM requires memory-optimized configurations
- **Container memory limits**: All services configured with appropriate memory constraints
- **Reduced Kafka partitions**: Single partition topics to reduce resource usage
- **MongoDB cache tuning**: WiredTiger cache limited to 256MB for memory efficiency
- **Acceptable for academic use**: Performance adequate for demonstrating IoT pipeline concepts
- **Learning value**: Experience optimizing for resource-constrained environments
