# Folder Rename Summary

## Changes Made

✅ **Renamed folder**: `CA1/ansible/` → `CA1/plant-monitor-IaC/`

✅ **Updated all README references**:
- Updated `CA1/README.md` to reflect new folder name and Terraform+Ansible architecture
- Updated project structure documentation
- Updated deployment command examples
- Added explanation of the new hybrid architecture

## Why This Name Makes Sense

The new name `plant-monitor-IaC` is much more accurate because:

1. **Technology Agnostic**: No longer tied to just Ansible
2. **Descriptive**: Clearly indicates this is for Infrastructure as Code
3. **Project Specific**: References the Plant Monitoring system
4. **Future Proof**: Can accommodate other IaC tools if needed

## Directory Structure After Rename

```
CA1/
├── README.md                    # Updated with new paths and architecture info
├── applications/                # Original CA0 application code
└── plant-monitor-IaC/          # ← RENAMED from 'ansible/'
    ├── deploy.sh               # Main deployment script
    ├── README.md               # Comprehensive documentation
    ├── terraform/              # Infrastructure as Code
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   ├── modules/
    │   └── generate-inventory.sh
    ├── application-deployment/  # Ansible playbooks
    │   ├── inventory.ini       # Auto-generated from Terraform
    │   └── *.yml
    └── archive/                # Preserved original work
        └── iac-ansible/
```

## No Functional Impact

- All scripts use relative paths, so they continue to work without changes
- The `deploy.sh` script works exactly the same way
- Terraform and Ansible configurations are unchanged
- Only documentation and folder organization updated

The rename better reflects the modern Terraform + Ansible architecture while preserving all the hard work that was done!
