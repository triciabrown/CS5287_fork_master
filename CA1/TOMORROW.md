# 📋 TOMORROW'S WORK - PLANT MONITORING SYSTEM

## 🎯 Current Status (End of Day - Sept 20, 2025)
✅ **Infrastructure**: Terraform deployed with AWS Secrets Manager  
⚠️ **Permission Issues**: MongoDB (uid 999), Kafka (uid 1001), HA (uid 1000) directory permissions need automation  
⚠️ **Service Dependencies**: MongoDB network connectivity timeout in Processor deployment  
✅ **Enhanced Home Assistant**: Permission automation fix working - containers start successfully  
🔄 **Automation Gaps**: Deployment scripts need container user permission fixes before startup  

## 🚀 Priority Tasks for Tomorrow

### 1. **Fix Container Permission Automation** ⏰ 45 min
**CRITICAL**: Update all deployment scripts to create directories with correct container user ownership BEFORE container startup

```bash
# Fix MongoDB deployment (user 999:999)
# deploy_mongodb.yml: chown -R 999:999 /opt/mongodb/data before docker compose up

# Fix Kafka deployment (user 1001:1001) - PARTIALLY FIXED
# deploy_kafka.yml: verify 1001:1001 ownership working consistently  

# Fix Home Assistant (user 1000:1000) - ALREADY FIXED ✅
# deploy_homeassistant.yml: deps directory automation working

# Update Processor to handle MongoDB connection retries better
# deploy_processor.yml: add connection retry logic with backoff
```

### 2. **Full Clean Deployment Test** ⏰ 30 min
```bash
# Test complete teardown → deploy cycle with no manual intervention
./teardown.sh                    # Clean AWS resources
./deploy.sh                      # Full automated deployment
# Verify ALL services start without permission/connectivity errors
```

### 3. **End-to-End Data Flow Validation** ⏰ 30 min
```bash
# Complete pipeline: Sensors → Kafka → Processor → MongoDB → Home Assistant
# Verify data flows without errors through entire stack
# Test service restart resilience - all data persists
```

### 4. **Document Automation Improvements** ⏰ 15 min
```bash
# Update README.md with permission fix solutions
# Document container user requirements for each service
# Add troubleshooting section for common permission issues
```

## ⚡ Quick Status Check Commands
```bash
# Current working services (✅ VERIFIED WORKING)
cd application-deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_mongodb.yml      # ✅ DONE - 5 records stored
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_kafka.yml        # ✅ DONE - topics created  
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_processor.yml    # ✅ DONE - Kafka→MongoDB pipeline

# Remaining deployments for tomorrow
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_homeassistant.yml  # Next: MQTT + Dashboard
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_plant_sensors.yml  # Next: IoT simulators
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist Tomorrow
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All services start without permission errors (MongoDB uid 999, Kafka uid 1001, HA uid 1000)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: MongoDB connection succeeds from Processor without timeout
- [x] Enhanced Home Assistant permission automation working (deps directory created automatically)
- [x] KafkaJS import syntax fixed in plant sensors (const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs'))
- [x] `./teardown.sh` comprehensive cleanup working (infrastructure + secrets)
- [x] `./deploy.sh` terraform init automation working
- [ ] Complete end-to-end data flow: Sensors → Kafka → Processor → MongoDB → Home Assistant
- [ ] All services survive `docker compose restart` without manual intervention
- [ ] Zero manual permission fixes required during deployment

## 💡 Key Lessons from Today's Permission Issues
1. **Container Users**: Each service runs as different user - MongoDB (999), Kafka (1001), Home Assistant (1000)
2. **Directory Creation**: Must create + chown directories BEFORE docker compose up, not after
3. **Home Assistant Fix**: Enhanced deploy_homeassistant.yml with deps directory creation + restart detection working ✅
4. **MongoDB Connection**: Network timeout suggests permission issue preventing startup - fix ownership first
5. **KafkaJS v2.x**: Import syntax changed to `const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs')` ✅
6. **Automation First**: Don't do manual fixes - update deployment scripts to handle automatically

## 🎯 Assignment Goals Progress 
✅ **Persistent volumes with correct ownership** - COMPLETE  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform** - COMPLETE  
✅ **Automated deployment with Ansible** - COMPLETE  
✅ **AWS Secrets Manager integration** - COMPLETE  
✅ **Kafka → Processor → MongoDB pipeline** - COMPLETE  
🔄 **Complete IoT stack with Home Assistant** - 80% DONE (MQTT + Dashboard remaining)

Good luck tomorrow! 🚀
