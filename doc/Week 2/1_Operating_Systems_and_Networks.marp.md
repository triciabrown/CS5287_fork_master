## What is an Operating System

* A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware
* Operating system goals
    * Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier
    * Make the computer system convenient to use
    * Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

## Operating System Definition

* OS is a resource allocator.
    * Manages all resources
    * Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
* OS is a control program.
    * Controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper  use of the computer

## Common Functions of Interrupts

- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally,
through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all
the service routines.
- Interrupt architecture must save the address of the interrupted instruction.
- Incoming interrupts are disabled while another interrupt is being processed to prevent a lost interrupt.
- A trap is a software -generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request.
- An operating system is interrupt driven.
