1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:02,441
All right.

2
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:06,632
Let's talk about IaaS or infra
infrastructure as a service.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,526
First off,
this fits really well in the cloud because

4
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:14,420
what we talk about about virtualization,
where I'm virtualizing compute,

5
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:19,601
storage, network and security
IaaS means I can do it on demand.

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:23,396
And this is what made cloud
really desirable to a lot of developers,

7
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:26,630
because I could easily
go to a self-service portal and say,

8
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:30,821
I need, three VMs and a network

9
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,055
and storage connected to them on a secure,

10
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,299
domain.

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,787
So that self-service part is, is critical,
for the growth of the cloud.

12
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:45,605
And I didn't have to go out and buy
machines before the cloud was long.

13
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:49,730
We saw a lot of shadow
it by people actually physically going out

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,426
and buying hardware
at like Fry's Electronics or Best Buy,

15
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:56,891
mostly Fry's in Silicon Valley,
which no longer exists.

16
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,343
They, you know, they're out of business.

17
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,445
That's an old old timers thing, I guess.

18
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,029
Makes me an old timer.

19
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:09,134
So I as it is that infrastructure
as a service, that ability to easily,

20
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:12,236
spin up these VMs and virtual networks

21
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:16,064
and virtual storage,
all very easily self-service portals.

22
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,011
Okay.

23
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,674
If we look at IaaS, also called software

24
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:24,677
defined infrastructure or SDI,

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,495
it has this whole concept of orchestration

26
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:33,257
where I'm orchestrating between, storage

27
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:36,590
network accelerators and compute,

28
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,276
all orchestrated by a software
defined orchestrator.

29
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:42,266
Right.

30
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:46,028
All resources are defined and provisioned
and managed by that orchestrator.

31
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:48,668
So there's that one point
and it makes it easy.

32
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:51,671
So there's one
API to go through in order to do this.

33
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,938
Or it could be a web interface
or anything like that.

34
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:58,403
Let's talk about each of the software
defined infrastructure elements.

35
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,624
Compute.

36
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:02,000
Compute is virtual machines

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,465
as we've already talked
about in previous lectures or vCPUs.

38
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:08,897
It also includes the Ram and everything
that's needed in there.

39
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,395
There's lots of public images out there
for the operating system

40
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,157
to run on these VMs that are available,
or you can create your own,

41
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:17,807
right.

42
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:21,074
There's also the ability to autoscale
these VMs.

43
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,826
I can put them in groups together
and auto scale, say I only need one VM.

44
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,895
Let's say it's Kafka Broker.

45
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,601
I only need one
VM in my cluster to begin with,

46
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,495
and then I can scale them
and replicate the brokers themselves,

47
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:38,069
and then they can self register
and all these cool things.

48
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,247
So those are auto scaling groups.

49
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:43,514
There's bare
metal provisioning that I can provision

50
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:46,946
physical servers
on demand with low latency.

51
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:51,137
And sometimes I need to do this
for licensing needs.

52
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:56,120
So software defined infrastructure
does not mean just virtual machines.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,123
I can actually do the same thing
with bare metal provisioning.

54
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:04,304
When provisioning a bare metal box to,
to do everything that I need it to do.

55
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,317
And I could do it on
demand, which is pretty cool.

56
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:08,561
All right.

57
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,541
Storage. Let's talk about storage.

58
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,653
Different types of storage
that I need to worry about.

59
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:17,075
Block storage,
which is persistent disks and volumes,

60
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,672
tunable IOPs on this.

61
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,675
This is this is what we're mostly used to
when we talk about,

62
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,734
block storage
that's out there that most of us deal with

63
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:31,958
when at the OS level, when we're working
with that object storage.

64
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,809
Huge benefits,
S3 type buckets, durable blobs.

65
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,746
They give me Https access.

66
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:42,749
And this is what we see in the cloud
mostly as object storage.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,950
And then I have file and NFS, storage.

68
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,831
There's lots in this space.

69
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:52,946
But these are network mounted file systems
that I can easily access

70
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:55,982
through the normal file system
that I'm used to.

71
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,655
And then there's
from your instant storage,

72
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:04,067
these are local SSDs or NVMe ease
that I use primarily for for cache.

73
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,410
These are running on the host themselves.

74
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,149
They're not out there on the network
like some of these.

75
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,878
Others tend to be, block storage,
object storage and file storage,

76
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,980
tend to be network mounted type of things.

77
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,049
So they're they're running more on network
infrastructure

78
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,184
and ephemeral, storage is local.

79
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:28,355
It is faster, primarily used for caching
and for virtual memory.

80
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,345
Yeah, you guessed it right.

81
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,315
You do not want on your

82
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,285
virtual memory
on us, on a software defined,

83
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,816
storage device. It's network bound.

84
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,093
That would be bad, right?

85
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:41,918
It would be slow.

86
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,535
And now your network bound.

87
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,317
All right. Networking.
Let's talk about networking.

88
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,175
Virtualization.

89
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,244
We've talked about this,
a couple in a couple other lectures.

90
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:53,996
We're isolating a, layer
three network with subnets

91
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:57,362
and routing tables
with your VPC and network virtualization.

92
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,893
I've got load balancers in there
that I can take advantage of.

93
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:06,305
I have a VPN where I can connect, secure
tunnels between on prem and off prem.

94
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,605
This will be very important
when you set up your hybrid clouds,

95
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,146
where you're doing
private and public clouds.

96
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:16,040
You want some VPN or direct
connect, capabilities there.

97
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,175
And then you have software
defined networking for routing

98
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:22,805
and netting and, and all these things
that are available as well.

99
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:26,831
And then don't forget your network
security, that you want to set up,

100
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:29,306
when you're doing this stuff.

101
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:32,968
Because security is not the responsibility

102
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,971
of the cloud service provider,
it's still your responsibility.

103
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,568
Ultimately,
they provide some tools and some,

104
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:42,175
they all have their own position
on security.

105
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,297
You need to understand that.

106
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:46,300
But ultimately it's your responsibility.

107
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:47,983
All right.

108
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,293
Security and identity.

109
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,527
It's it's built into every cloud service
providers.

110
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,233
I can't emphasize this a much and enough.

111
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,137
Learn
what each cloud service provider provides

112
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:03,988
and their philosophy behind,
their security understanding

113
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,991
that will make your, solution
much more secure.

114
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,192
Understanding, the different aspects,

115
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:14,680
both on identity and on security,
who's who's keeping

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,145
you know, your security tokens
and your credentials.

117
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:22,039
And are you managing them yourselves
or are they managed in the cloud?

118
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:25,867
Also, don't forget about, security
monitoring and detection.

119
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,375
Those are important aspects.

120
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,431
And like I said before,

121
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,325
all the cloud service providers
provide some aspects of security.

122
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,229
It may be sufficient for what you need.
It may not.

123
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,694
You need to learn what those are
and how to work in that ecosystem.

124
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,070
All right.

125
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,096
Accelerators, this is big right
now, especially with generative AI.

126
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:50,584
And talking about,
GPUs and other accelerators

127
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:54,214
that are, available out there in the cloud
service providers.

128
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:58,603
And believe it or not, many
of the instances that are in the cloud,

129
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:01,804
people don't know
that there's accelerators, baked

130
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,807
in, especially,
you know, a lot of the Intel instances

131
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:08,041
where they've got accelerators
baked into their CPUs.

132
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:13,057
Learn what, what instances those are
and how you can take

133
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,027
advantage of those accelerators
if you need speed up.

134
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:21,307
Also realize that if you are using
these accelerators, that your VMs

135
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,564
now need to be tied to the specific types
of accelerators that are available.

136
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:31,042
So if you are tied to like an Nvidia GPU,
you need to make sure that, VM

137
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:34,045
that you're running that the host,
the instance type

138
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:37,246
that you're running in the cloud
has that GPU available.

139
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,546
People tend to pay more for,

140
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:44,803
the higher end
accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs, but,

141
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,004
also look at the individual

142
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:51,535
CPUs because a lot of CPUs
have acceleration built in.

143
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,264
They're little chip
lets for no better word.

144
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:59,620
That said, directly in the CPU
that can provide, lots of acceleration

145
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,953
if you just know how to use it.

146
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:04,141
All right.

147
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:07,837
Some common interfaces for IaaS, a web
console.

148
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:08,860
Most of us know this.

149
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,863
When we go to AWS, Azure or Google,

150
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:16,186
there's a nice, web interface
or a GUI where I can easily.

151
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:20,608
Hey, I need, five instances of this,
and I need a VPN, and you're,

152
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,159
you know, click, click, click.

153
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,459
But most of the cloud service providers
provide

154
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,155
both a Rest API
and a command line interface or CLI,

155
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:33,940
and they also provide, software
defined, software development kits.

156
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:38,461
So from languages, I can actually start
spinning up and tearing down,

157
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,563
different types of,

158
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,028
infrastructure that I need in order to do,
my application.

159
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:46,546
There are also

160
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:50,704
and the emergence that we're going to talk
about this infrastructure as code tools

161
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:54,466
that are out there,
and there's a whole lecture on AI,

162
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:59,647
IAC, as well as, two of the most popular,
which is Terraform and Ansible.

163
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:05,257
That will, let me with code
very easily define my infrastructure,

164
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:09,613
and then it will pass
through these Yaml files or Json files

165
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:13,573
and spin up the code for me,
which is really, really kind of cool.

166
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:17,896
And then also when we talk about,

167
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,757
more dynamic use of Iirc

168
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,892
there's operation
operators and provisioner

169
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:29,314
that can do things more dynamically
based off of events that are occurring.

170
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:32,317
So, we'll, we'll cover those things,

171
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,452
in, in these lectures as well.

172
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:36,277
All right.

173
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:40,402
Key takeaways I want you to all understand
I has abstraction layers,

174
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,636
compute, storage, network

175
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,560
accelerators.

176
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,629
And don't
forget about security out there okay.

177
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,764
And then everything can be managed
via an API.

178
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:55,219
That's the whole idea
behind, infrastructure as a service,

179
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:58,717
that it's software defined infrastructure
that I can

180
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:03,931
with software provision, infrastructure
at will and get

181
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:07,726
whatever I need for scalability,
security and cost efficiency.
