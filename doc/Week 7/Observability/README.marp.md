# Observability in the Cloud
Video: https://youtu.be/xSoPSeQ9fIE

## 1. Introduction
- **Observability**: The ability to infer internal system states from external outputs.
- **Why it matters in the cloud**:
    - Highly dynamic, ephemeral infrastructure
    - Rapid scaling and deployments
    - Complex, polyglot microservices

---

## 2. The Three Pillars
1. **Metrics**
    - Numeric measurements over time (e.g., CPU, error rates, request latency)
    - Aggregated into time-series databases
2. **Logs**
    - Timestamped, structured or unstructured events
    - Capture business and technical context
3. **Distributed Tracing**
    - End-to-end request flows across services
    - Spans, traces, context propagation

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 SLIs, SLOs, SLAs
- **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**: Measurable metric (e.g., 99th-percentile latency)
- **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: Target for an SLI (e.g., 99% of requests < 200 ms)
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Contractual guarantee

### 3.2 Telemetry Signals
- **Client-side** vs. **Server-side** instrumentation
- **OpenTelemetry**: Vendor-neutral SDK & API for metrics, logs, traces

## 4. Cloud-Native Tools

| Category         | Examples                     |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Metrics          | Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch   |
| Dashboards       | Grafana, CloudWatch Insights |
| Distributed Tracing | Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray |
| Logging          | ElasticSearch / Kibana, Cloud Logging |
| Alerting         | Alertmanager, PagerDuty      |

---

## 5. Architecture Patterns

1. **Sidecar / Agent**
    - Deployed alongside apps (e.g., Fluentd, Envoy with OpenTelemetry)
2. **DaemonSet / Node Agent**
    - Runs on every node to collect host-level metrics/logs
3. **Push vs. Pull**
    - **Push**: Agents send telemetry to a collector
    - **Pull**: Monitoring system scrapes exporters

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Instrument early**: Bake in metrics/tracing from day one
- **Use structured logging**: JSON or key/value for easy parsing
- **Define SLIs & SLOs**: Focus on meaningful user-centric targets
- **Correlation IDs**: Propagate request IDs through logs, metrics, traces
- **Tagging & Labels**: Enrich telemetry with service, region, environment

---

## 7. Scaling Observability

- **High-cardinality labels**: Watch out for cardinality explosion in metrics
- **Sampling**: For traces, use head-based or tail-based sampling
- **Retention policies**: Balance cost vs. historical analysis needs
- **Multi-tenant considerations**: Isolate teams and workloads

---

## 8. Alerting & Incident Response

1. **Alerting Rules**
    - Thresholds on SLO burn rate, error rates, resource saturation
2. **On-call Playbooks**
    - Document steps for common issues
3. **Runbooks & Automation**
    - Automated remediation (auto-scaling, circuit breakers)
4. **Post-mortems**
    - Blameless analysis, continuous improvement

---

## 9. Case Study: E-Commerce Checkout

1. **Metrics**:
    - Checkout success rate (SLI)
    - 95th-percentile payment latency (SLO < 2 s)
2. **Tracing**:
    - Map customer journey (cart → payment gateway → inventory)
3. **Logging**:
    - Capture payment provider responses, error codes
4. **Dashboards & Alerts**:
    - Grafana dashboard with real-time KPIs
    - Alert when checkout success < 99% in 5 min

---

## 10. Summary

- Observability is **essential** for resilient, scalable cloud systems.
- Leverage metrics, logs, and tracing in tandem.
- Define clear SLIs/SLOs and automate alerting.
- Continuously iterate: instrument more, refine dashboards, reduce noise.
