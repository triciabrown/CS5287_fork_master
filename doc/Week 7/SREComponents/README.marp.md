# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Components in Cloud Computing

---

Video: https://youtu.be/bQyqQPPx-eg

# Introduction
- Applies software engineering to operations
- Ensures reliability, scalability, efficiency
- Balances feature velocity and uptime
- Drives automation and continuous improvement

---

# 1. SLIs & SLOs
- SLIs: key health metrics (latency, errors)
- SLOs: targets for SLIs (e.g. 99.9% < 100 ms)
- Align with user expectations
- Regularly review and adjust
- Share dashboards transparently

---

# 2. Error Budgets
- Budget = 100% − SLO
- Guides feature vs. reliability work
- Monitor burn rate continuously
- Enforce freezes when budget low
- Learn via blameless postmortems

---

# 3. Monitoring & Observability
- Collect metrics (CPU, req. time)
- Structured, contextual logs
- Distributed tracing for latency
- Dashboards with actionable alerts
- Use open standards (Prometheus, OT)

---

# 4. Alerting & On-Call
- Alert on user-impact symptoms
- Suppress noise, dedupe alerts
- Fair, documented on-call rotations
- Clear escalation paths
- Linked runbooks for each alert

---

# 5. Incident Response
- Runbooks for known failures
- Centralized ChatOps “war rooms”
- Blameless postmortems + action items
- Track MTTA & MTTR metrics
- Maintain incident knowledge base

---

# 6. Automation & Orchestration
- CI/CD for build, test, deploy
- Canary & blue-green rollouts
- Auto-remediation scripts/operators
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Chaos experiments for resilience

---

# 7. Capacity & Performance
- Forecast resource needs
- Right-size instances continuously
- Reactive & predictive autoscaling
- Balance cost vs. performance
- Regular load and stress testing

---

# 8. Security & Compliance
- Shift-left vulnerability scanning
- IaC configuration checks
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Compliance-as-code (PCI, HIPAA)
- Joint security-ops incident drills

---

# 9. Reliability Culture
- “You build it, you run it” ethos
- Blameless reviews, shared learning
- Brown-bags, tech talks, docs
- Dev-ops-security collaboration
- Continuous process retrospectives

---

# Conclusion & Best Practices
- Set clear, business-aligned SLOs
- Automate to eliminate toil
- Cultivate blameless, learning culture
- Invest in full-stack observability
- Iterate using metrics and postmortems
