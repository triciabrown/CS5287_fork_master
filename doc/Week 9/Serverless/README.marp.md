# Serverless in Cloud Computing

## Leveraging FaaS, PaaS and Self-Hosted Models

---

# 1. What Is Serverless?
- A cloud execution model where the provider dynamically manages resource allocation
- Developers deploy functions or containers; infra is abstracted away
- Pay-per-use billing (invocations, execution time, memory)
- No servers to provision, patch, or scale manually

---

# 2. Execution Models
## 2.1 Function as a Service (FaaS)
- Granular, event-driven functions
- Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

## 2.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Deploy entire applications or microservices
- Runtime, frameworks, and OS managed by provider
- Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine

## 2.3 Self-Hosted “Serverless”
- Run open-source FaaS frameworks on your infra
- Examples: OpenFaaS, Knative, Apache OpenWhisk

---

# 3. Typical Use Cases
- **API backends**: lightweight, event-driven REST endpoints
- **Data processing pipelines**: ETL jobs triggered by storage or messaging events
- **Real-time stream processing**: processing messages/Kafka streams
- **Scheduled tasks**: cron-style jobs without a VM
- **Webhooks & bots**: respond to third-party events on demand

---

# 4. Advantages of Serverless
- **Operational simplicity**: no server lifecycle management
- **Automatic scaling**: transparent scale-up/down per invocation
- **Cost efficiency**: pay only for actual usage
- **Rapid deployment**: focus on code, not infra
- **Built-in high availability**: provider handles redundancy

---

# 5. Disadvantages & Trade-Offs
- **Cold starts**: latency on first invocation after idle period
- **Vendor lock-in**: proprietary APIs, runtimes, and deployment tooling
- **Limited execution time**: max timeout per provider (e.g., 15m for Lambda)
- **Resource limits**: memory, CPU, ephemeral storage quotas
- **Complex debugging & monitoring**: distributed, event-driven architecture

# 6. FaaS vs PaaS vs Self-Hosted
| Feature         | FaaS (Lambda)      | PaaS (App Engine)   | Self-Hosted FaaS    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Management      | Minimal            | Moderate            | High                |
| Startup latency | Cold start impact  | Warm container      | Varies by infra     |
| Scalability     | Instantaneous      | Auto-scale policies | Dependent on cluster|
| Cost model      | Per-call           | Instance hours      | Infra + ops costs   |
| Lock-in risk    | High               | Medium              | Low                 |

---

# 7. Key Considerations & Best Practices
- **Optimize cold starts**: use Provisioned Concurrency, small packages, warmers
- **Stateless design**: functions should not rely on local state
- **Observability**: centralized logging (CloudWatch, Stackdriver), distributed tracing
- **Security**: least-privilege IAM roles, network isolation, secret management
- **CI/CD**: automate builds, tests, blue/green or canary deployments

---

# 8. When to Self-Host?
- Strict compliance or data residency requirements
- Avoid vendor lock-in or proprietary limitations
- Customize runtime beyond provider offerings
- Leverage existing on-premises infra investments
- You have a dedicated DevOps team

---

# 9. Summary & Next Steps
1. Identify workloads that fit event-driven models
2. Prototype with a managed FaaS (e.g., AWS Lambda)
3. Benchmark cold starts, concurrency, and cost
4. Explore hybrid: managed FaaS + self-hosted for critical paths
5. Implement observability and security guardrails
